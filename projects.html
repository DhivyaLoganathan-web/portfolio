                 <p> we propose a system to monitor heath condition of sea navigators while navigation. Using a communication system we can monitor a diving navigators heart beat, respiratory, body temperature even in ground.
                     If we found any change in his health conditions we can say him to enter the ground. So we can save the life of too many navigators.</p>
